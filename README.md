# Wine_Quality
It’s a well-established fact that age makes wine better – the older the wine, the better it will taste. However, age is not the only thing that determines a wine’s taste. Numerous factors determine the wine quality certification, including physicochemical tests such as alcohol quantity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, density, and pH level, to name a few.  In this ML project, you need to develop an ML model that can explore a wine’s chemical properties to predict its quality. The wine quality dataset you’ll be using for this project consists of approximately 4898 observations, including 11 independent variables and one dependent variable. Mentioning Machine Learning projects for the final year can help your resume look much more interesting than others.
